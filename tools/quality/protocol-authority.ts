/**
 * Where each OpenAPI contract's protocol authority document lives.
 *
 * Until milestone γ 3.5 every application document sat in the hub, so a single
 * anchor sufficed. The hub was archived on 2026-07-30 and its `docs/` tree left
 * with the second removal wave: that anchor now resolves to 404 for every
 * contract, and the whole protocol-authority check fails open-eyed but silent
 * until someone pushes. ADR-0020 names the replacement — each repository owns
 * its perimeter, and the ecosystem index says which application it owns.
 *
 * The index is read from the SHA-pinned `@libre-ai/governance` git dependency,
 * so this resolution is as deterministic as the pin itself.
