# Review dossier — Authorized execution contracts

- **Specification Locked family:** `execution-graph-v1`, `execution-plan-body-v2`,
  `execution-transfer-v1`, `execution-authorization-v2`,
  `human-decision-request-v1`, `human-decision-response-v1`,
  `step-invocation-v1`, `effect-attestation-v1`, `orchestrator-event-v3`,
  `retention-policy-schema-v2` and `retention-policy-v2`.
- **Status:** `locked` by promotion target
  `5b9b6668909119b670e0db62174419ab04e5b402`; authored and reviewed as one
  protocol family.
- **Required roles:** architecture, security and privacy.
- **Owner decisions:** Governance ADR-0034/D40 authorized candidate contract
  design only; ADR-0036/D42 at Governance main
  `a16c8657881cfbd79a3915b218e0a148bc01bd78` separately authorizes this exact
  Specification Lock. Neither decision authorizes runtime adoption.

## Binding review protocol

Review follows Governance
[`AGENT-REVIEW-PROTOCOL.md`](https://github.com/libre-ai/governance/blob/main/docs/reviews/AGENT-REVIEW-PROTOCOL.md):
role-scoped review-only passes run against one immutable authoring commit. The same session may
perform serial passes, but authoring and review contexts remain separate. Findings are remediated
in a new authoring commit and all affected roles re-review the new immutable commit.

## Authority and security invariants

- Contracts own every wire shape, preimage and closed outcome. SDKs are disposable projections;
  no runtime repository is changed by this candidate.
- LangGraph remains a research and failure-scenario oracle. It is neither a dependency nor an
  implicit specification.
- Organization, lineage, generation, causal digest, one-shot decision and effect identities are
  explicit and bounded. Reuse with divergent content quarantines instead of overwriting.
- Raw prompts, tool arguments, destinations, observations, human comments and personal data are
  excluded from execution records and operational errors; only classified artifact references
  may carry such content.
- Existing retention v1 rules remain byte-intact. The v2 candidate adds only the content-free
  execution record and deletion tombstone classes authorized by the design.

## Immutable reviewed set

The three specialized passes below reviewed one clean, immutable cross-repository set on
2026-09-10:

- Governance design and plan: commit `388b89bdba89c80a39b560b3284d8984101813ce`;
- Contracts authority: commit `cb865613039c78e344bcbb51f4dbdfd469f634b9`, contracts tree
  `8015ead233c805a30f2bb1e74c5feedaaafdb7ce`, quality-checker tree
  `f9fc981cba086f175a5b2b68f25f49b141690522`;
- TypeScript projection: commit `1c5f26076f622a7a3d129b87465bfa6905df0d70`, tree
  `eca20d1018215aae94a6c4a7530a0c2a5cf0e092`;
- Rust projection: commit `9c1201eb0f1f40bd45df637f053be98846070bc4`, tree
  `a7dce082b9c0689db92cea915f05ec7bcd5ab683`.

Both SDK manifests pin the complete Contracts SHA above. Their ten authorized-execution schema
copies are byte-identical to the authority. The TypeScript projection also synchronizes five
other schemas introduced between its previous pin and this authority SHA; those files are a
mechanical consequence of the repository-wide byte-drift gate, not new authority in this dossier.

## Remediation history before the final passes

The first authoring commit `3f406b668785b50d1ef78c624ff4782d91513d96` was not approved.
An architecture challenge found missing Graph/Plan binding semantics, an event effect-status
mismatch, incomplete one-shot transfer/decision replay scenarios and a self-declared human actor.
Commit `8b22a3dbe3970f2475590c6e76835badf1108b17` closed those findings, added strict UTC/expiry and
old-run checks, and bound the positive Graph and Plan fixtures in CI. Rust projection then exposed
a recursive Typify name collision in `orchestrator-event.v3`; commit
`cb865613039c78e344bcbb51f4dbdfd469f634b9` replaced that nullable reference with a bounded direct
wire shape. Every earlier informal verdict was treated as stale.

## Role-separated review passes

The harness exposes the reviewing agent as `Codex / root`; it does not expose a stable session,
provider or model identifier, so none is invented. Every pass was review-only, started and ended
with all three reviewed worktrees clean, and produced exactly one verdict.

### `authorized-execution-architecture-20260910-01`

- **Role / mode:** architecture / specialized catalog role.
- **Evidence:** `bun test tools/quality/authorized-execution.test.ts` (71/71), Contracts checker,
  TypeScript `generate:check` plus registry/digest tests (155/155), Rust schema drift gate plus
  schema/digest tests (6/6), exact schema `cmp`, exact pins, authority-addition inventory and
  unchanged-authority diff.
- **Findings:** Blocking 0; Major 0; Minor 0; non-blocking 0.
- **Residual risk:** runtime state-machine conformance is intentionally unproven in Phase 3; Phase
  4 must consume the semantic vectors independently before any product-engine enablement.
- **Verdict:** `approve`.

### `authorized-execution-security-20260910-01`

- **Role / mode:** security / specialized catalog role.
- **Evidence:** 71 semantic tests; explicit graph/organization/run/attempt/authorization
  substitution, collision, divergent replay, consumed generation, exact-expiry, fencing,
  two-emission, unknown-state and administrative-closure cases; nine digest reproductions in both
  SDKs; repository secret and personal-data scans.
- **Findings:** Blocking 0; Major 0; Minor 0; non-blocking 0.
- **Residual risk:** schemas and vectors define fail-closed behavior but do not make a future
  runtime atomic; the Phase 4 storage implementation must prove transaction serialization and
  executor-side idempotency without weakening these outcomes.
- **Verdict:** `approve`.

### `authorized-execution-privacy-20260910-01`

- **Role / mode:** privacy / specialized catalog role.
- **Evidence:** personal-data scans in all three repositories; tenant-private classification for
  all execution records; content-free references instead of prompts, comments, destinations or
  observations; exact semantic equality of the 15 inherited v1 retention rules; P1Y/P6Y mission
  alignment; exact P35D tombstone; tombstone-first restore tests in Contracts and both SDK schema
  suites.
- **Findings:** Blocking 0; Major 0; Minor 0; non-blocking 0.
- **Residual risk:** a future operational logger can still violate the contract by logging wire
  values; runtime log allow-list and deletion/restore integration tests remain mandatory before
  enablement.
- **Verdict:** `approve`.

These approvals satisfied the candidate's three catalog roles for the immutable authority SHA.
Before the separate owner act and promotion target recorded below, the catalog correctly remained
`candidate` with `pending-independent-agent-review`; the role records alone were not a
Specification Lock.

## Candidate-integration pass

### `authorized-execution-candidate-integration-20260910-01`

- **Mode:** candidate-integration; this is not a specialized promotion approval.
- **Reviewed heads:** Governance `388b89bdba89c80a39b560b3284d8984101813ce`; Contracts
  `47bc543a3189cc969e41bc39b3b69c540bd72802` (dossier-only successor of the reviewed authority);
  SDK TypeScript `1c5f26076f622a7a3d129b87465bfa6905df0d70`; SDK Rust
  `9c1201eb0f1f40bd45df637f053be98846070bc4`.
- **Evidence:** fresh full repository gates on all four heads; Contracts 221 tests; TypeScript 208
  tests; Rust 14 tests including doc-tests; Rust `cargo deny check licenses`; zero-warning lints and
  typechecks; byte-drift gates; secret and personal-data scans; REUSE; clean worktrees. The
  Contracts tree remained `8015ead233c805a30f2bb1e74c5feedaaafdb7ce` after the role records.
- **Sovereignty:** no dependency, managed service, runtime network, telemetry, checkpoint store,
  US hyperscaler or runtime repository was introduced. LangGraph remains a question/failure oracle
  only and is absent from contracts, pins and projections.
- **Findings:** Blocking 0; Major 0; Minor 0; non-blocking 0.
- **Residual risks:** remote branch and post-merge CI still have to reproduce the local gates;
  candidate status authorizes no runtime adoption.
- **Verdict:** `approve` for candidate integration only.

## Specification Lock promotion

- **Promotion base:** `bba034fb081ecd56bcf34c96592a6122a6527b6c`.
- **Immutable promotion target:** `5b9b6668909119b670e0db62174419ab04e5b402`.
- **Promotion target tree:** `20f934deacddd14bef6d83a2d83abf4b0a81330c`.
- **Governance owner act on main:**
  `a16c8657881cfbd79a3915b218e0a148bc01bd78` (ADR-0036/D42).
- **Catalog SHA-256:**
  `6e892492617c0a78a17b1d55b09c2b6efd27390640dfc8b49f36577298827e52`
  before promotion;
  `17c2a6742d83a3d0d115048b948a03b0ab3b986f29e73e3e3bc6ff41cb0de4e7`
  on the target.
- **Scope:** exactly the eleven family IDs above, `candidate -> locked`, with
  only their satisfied review objects removed.
- **Runtime/data/release:** **NOT AUTHORIZED**.

The same `Codex / root` identity performed the following serial review-only
passes as permitted by the Governance review protocol. The target worktree was
clean before and after the passes; no review pass modified it. The harness does
not expose a stable session, provider or model identifier, so none is invented.

### `authorized-execution-lock-architecture-20260910-01`

- **Evidence:** the structured catalog comparison proves 11 exact promotions,
  92 unrelated entries byte-equivalent as parsed JSON, `99 locked / 4
  candidate`, and the four remaining candidate IDs exact. The diff from the
  reviewed authority SHA is empty for all ten schemas, retention v2 data and
  both vector files. Documentation states the same authority/runtime boundary.
- **Findings:** Blocking 0; Major 0; Minor 0; non-blocking 0.
- **Residual risk:** a runtime state machine has not demonstrated conformance to
  the locked vectors; Phase 4 remains closed.
- **Verdict:** `approve`.

### `authorized-execution-lock-security-20260910-01`

- **Evidence:** the executable lock test reproduces all 13 reviewed hashes and
  rejects missing status, retained review state, extra promotion or wrong
  counts. `bun run check` passes the contract checker, secret scan,
  personal-data boundary, zero-warning lint, strict typecheck and 224 tests / 0
  failures. `package.json`, `bun.lock` and all runtime paths are unchanged.
- **Findings:** Blocking 0; Major 0; Minor 0; non-blocking 0.
- **Residual risk:** locked schemas cannot themselves make storage transitions
  atomic or external effects idempotent/fenced; both remain blocking Phase 4
  integration proofs.
- **Verdict:** `approve`.

### `authorized-execution-lock-privacy-20260910-01`

- **Evidence:** all classifications, schema bytes and retention v2 bytes remain
  unchanged; the reviewed retention data hash is
  `1622c32bf106160a524590db42bd0e8a0e7bbbadc2ee1bedd5dbb9bddef9db84`.
  The personal-data and secret gates pass, and the promotion adds no record,
  subject data, log value or external transmission.
- **Findings:** Blocking 0; Major 0; Minor 0; non-blocking 0.
- **Residual risk:** a future logger can still copy tenant-private wire values;
  allow-list and deletion/restore E2E tests remain mandatory before enablement.
- **Verdict:** `approve`.

### `authorized-execution-lock-promotion-integration-20260910-01`

- **Evidence:** the candidate authority SHA is an ancestor of the promotion
  target; Governance ADR-0036/D42 is present on `origin/main`; all reviewed
  hashes match; the focused lock gate passes 3 tests / 49 assertions; the full
  repository gate passes 224 tests / 357 assertions; `reuse lint` covers
  225/225 files; `git diff --check` passes; all commits carry DCO sign-off.
- **Sovereignty:** no dependency, managed service, US hyperscaler, telemetry,
  checkpoint store, runtime network or infrastructure is added. LangGraph,
  LangChain and LangSmith remain absent from dependencies and normative bytes.
- **Findings:** Blocking 0; Major 0; Minor 0; non-blocking 0.
- **Residual risks:** SDK pins and remote/post-merge CI remain to be reproduced;
  they cannot expand the lock into runtime authority.
- **Verdict:** `approve` for the exact technical promotion.

Any authority-byte drift, additional status transition, stale Governance act,
red gate, SDK projection drift or runtime expansion invalidates these verdicts.
Rollback before a separately authorized runtime exists is a revert of the
catalog/lifecycle promotion and SDK pins; no data migration is required.

## Post-merge SDK integration closeout

### `authorized-execution-lock-final-integration-20260910-01`

- **Mode:** final cross-repository review-only closeout; no authority or runtime
  authoring.
- **Reviewed default-branch heads:** Governance
  `a16c8657881cfbd79a3915b218e0a148bc01bd78`; Contracts
  `a4c1a42d3e004e8c66886e2a18c21b728e9078f1`; SDK TypeScript
  `7067049b2adbf39b37a9fa71dc6fdb7e6b6fd7f1`; SDK Rust
  `ac9f2020425733183839a58fc2c3928a4de5c066`.
- **Pins:** both SDK default branches name the immutable Contracts promotion
  target `5b9b6668909119b670e0db62174419ab04e5b402`; that commit is an ancestor of
  Contracts main. The installed catalog SHA-256 is
  `17c2a6742d83a3d0d115048b948a03b0ab3b986f29e73e3e3bc6ff41cb0de4e7`.
- **TypeScript evidence:** PR #9 and post-merge CI pass; 209 tests / 687
  assertions pass; all 75 generated projections and vendored schemas remain
  byte-exact, with no generated file in the pin diff.
- **Rust evidence:** PR #14 and post-merge CI pass; the lock, schema drift,
  secret, personal-data, lint and strict type gates pass; 14 Rust tests plus
  doc-tests pass; `cargo fmt --all --check`, clippy with `-D warnings` and
  dependency-policy licensing pass. All 75 vendored schemas and generated Rust
  types remain unchanged.
- **Authority evidence:** Governance PR #104, Contracts PR #14 and every
  post-merge workflow on the four reviewed heads pass. Contracts main reports
  `99 locked / 4 candidate`, with exactly `boussole-method-v3`,
  `harness-profile-v2`, `local-comparison-v3` and
  `public-vote-dataset-v3` remaining candidates.
- **Security/privacy/sovereignty:** no runtime, schema, retention data, vector,
  generated projection, capability, service, infrastructure, telemetry or
  external dependency was added. No personal or tenant-private value is added
  to logs or review evidence. LangGraph remains absent from normative bytes and
  dependencies.
- **Findings:** Blocking 0; Major 0; Minor 0; non-blocking 0.
- **Residual runtime gates:** transaction serialization, executor-side
  idempotency/fencing, log allow-listing and deletion/restore E2E remain
  unproven and blocking before any Phase 4 enablement.
- **Verdict:** `approve` for completed Specification Lock integration only.

This closeout resolves the earlier promotion-pass residual concerning SDK pins
and remote/post-merge CI. It does not resolve or waive any runtime residual.
