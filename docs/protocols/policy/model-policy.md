# Model Policy

- **Path:** `apps/model-policy`
- **Owner:** Experiences / Model Policy
- **Runtime:** Bun.serve/React BFF plus Rust policy core compiled to WASM
- **Tenant model:** organization

## Purpose and actors

Model Policy lets an organization define sourced eligibility rules, capture a versioned model/provider snapshot and obtain a deterministic deny-by-default verdict with traceable explanations. Policy editors propose; approvers accept immutable policy versions; evaluators compare a declared need and snapshot.

## Journeys

1. **Author/approve policy:** editor creates rules with sources and unknown handling; approver reviews diff and accepts immutable version.
2. **Build snapshot:** evaluator imports sourced model/provider facts, validates provenance/licence/date and freezes snapshot hash.
3. **Evaluate need:** user describes bounded requirements, runs local deterministic evaluation and inspects verdict, failed/unknown rules and evidence.
4. **Export/replay:** user exports need/policy/snapshot/result hashes and replays with same engine version for identical result.

## Non-goals

- benchmark leaderboard, model quality oracle or procurement decision automation ;
- inferring jurisdiction from company origin ;
- scraping or redistributing restricted benchmark/licence data ;
- provider network calls during deterministic evaluation ;
- treating missing facts as compliant.

## Domain protocol

**Commands:** `CreatePolicyDraft`, `AddPolicyRule`, `SubmitPolicyForApproval`, `ApprovePolicyVersion`, `ImportModelSnapshot`, `ValidateSnapshot`, `CreateNeed`, `EvaluateEligibility`, `ExportEvaluation`, `RevokeSnapshot`.

**Queries:** `GetPolicyVersion`, `DiffPolicyVersions`, `GetSnapshot`, `ListSnapshotEvidence`, `GetEvaluation`, `ExplainRuleResult`, `ReplayEvaluation`.

**Events:** `PolicyDraftCreated`, `PolicyVersionApproved`, `SnapshotImported`, `SnapshotValidated`, `SnapshotRejected`, `EligibilityEvaluated`, `EvaluationExported`, `SnapshotRevoked`.

Verdict is `eligible | ineligible | indeterminate`; only all mandatory rules satisfied with complete required facts yields `eligible`. Revocation prevents new evaluation but does not rewrite past evidence.

## Refusal matrix

Closed component errors remain distinct from successful `unknown` rule evidence.

| Code | Boundary behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `policy.version_unapproved` | evaluation requests draft/unapproved policy |
| `policy.snapshot_unsourced` | required fact lacks source/provenance |
| `policy.snapshot_stale` | successful evaluation with an `unknown` rule; verdict becomes indeterminate/ineligible per policy |
| `policy.origin_jurisdiction_conflated` | upstream source adapter refusal before evaluation |
| `policy.fact_absent` | successful evaluation with an `unknown` rule; verdict becomes indeterminate/ineligible per policy |
| `policy.rule_unbounded` | rule uses unsupported/non-deterministic operation |
| `policy.dataset_redistribution_forbidden` | export would include restricted source payload |
| `policy.engine_version_unknown` | no qualified evaluator for contract/engine version |
| `policy.tenant_mismatch` | policy/snapshot/need tenant differs |

The v2 HTTP refusal envelope contains only a stable code and opaque request ID;
localized explanations are static UI mappings and never host-supplied free text.
The UI may explain indeterminate but cannot override it to eligible.

## Data

PostgreSQL owns organization policies, immutable accepted versions, source references, snapshot facts/provenance, needs and evaluation manifests. Restricted source payloads are not stored unless licence explicitly permits and owner approves; only sanitized public HTTPS citations with DNS-shaped hosts and without localhost, IP literals, userinfo, query or fragment, digests and derived allowed facts persist. Citations contain no credential, email or other personal data. Model IDs are opaque `mdl_*` values and textual facts are bounded machine tokens, never free-form personal content. Accepted policy/snapshot records follow ADR-0002 section 3 retention and remain immutable while referenced. Migration source is selected public model-policy/policy contracts and accepted source datasets, not historical private tables.

## Authentication and authorization

All Model Policy v2 reads, editing and evaluation require an opaque organization session and tenant. A future public reference policy is a reviewed Website projection, not a public Model Policy API exception. Biscuit resources are `policy/<id>/<version>`, `snapshot/<id>` and `evaluation/<id>`. Policy v2 records an opaque `usr_*` or `svc_*` `proposedBy` and a distinct opaque human `usr_*` `approval.approverId`; a service, agent or editor may propose but cannot approve its own version. The candidate Rust policy core receives no token; Bun authorizes then passes canonical policy/need/snapshot bytes. RLS repeats tenant isolation.

## Runtime boundaries

TypeScript owns authoring, human approval, persistence, source adapter and explanations UI. The candidate Rust/WASM boundary reserves schema-validated pure evaluation, stable rule IDs, deterministic trace and canonical result hashing; this contract amendment implements no engine. The future component has no HTTP, clock, randomness, identity or DB; evaluation time/source freshness is explicit input.

## Accessibility and degraded mode

Policy diff, verdict and rule trace have structured tables/lists and do not rely on color. Keyboard/screen-reader users can inspect each failed/unknown rule and source. Evaluation runs locally after required artifacts load. Source network outage blocks new snapshot refresh but permits replay of accepted snapshots with prominent age; revoked snapshots fail closed.

## Contracts

Locked v1 baseline:

- Policy Definition — `contracts/schemas/policy-definition.v1.schema.json` ;
- Policy Need — `contracts/schemas/policy-need.v1.schema.json` ;
- Model Snapshot — `contracts/schemas/model-snapshot.v1.schema.json` ;
- Policy Evaluation — `contracts/schemas/policy-evaluation.v1.schema.json` ;
- Model Policy API — `contracts/openapi/model-policy.v1.yaml` ;
- pure evaluator boundary — `contracts/wit/policy-core-v1/world.wit` ;
- normative evaluator semantics — `contracts/wit/policy-core-v1/SEMANTICS.md`.

Candidate v2 amendment:

- Policy Definition v2 — `contracts/schemas/policy-definition.v2.schema.json` ;
- Policy Need v2 — `contracts/schemas/policy-need.v2.schema.json` ;
- Model Snapshot v2 — `contracts/schemas/model-snapshot.v2.schema.json` ;
- Policy Evaluation v2 — `contracts/schemas/policy-evaluation.v2.schema.json` ;
- Model Policy API v2 — `contracts/openapi/model-policy.v2.yaml` ;
- pure evaluator candidate — `contracts/wit/policy-core-v2/world.wit` ;
- normative evaluator semantics — `contracts/wit/policy-core-v2/SEMANTICS.md`.

## Evidence

Golden vectors cover every operator, unknown path, source age and origin/jurisdiction distinction in Rust and TypeScript. Byte-exact decoder refusals, schema-valid exact byte ceilings, ceiling+1 refusals, depth 64 and cardinality-derived CPU/256 MiB memory qualification ceilings are checked before implementation. Property tests prove order independence and deny-by-default. Contract fixtures include restricted payload and cross-tenant negatives. E2E covers author/approve/import/evaluate/export/replay. Supply-chain/licence gate checks every bundled dataset.

## Work packages

1. policy/snapshot/evaluation schemas and golden vectors — Canonical Core ;
2. deterministic Rust evaluator and WIT — Specialized Rust ;
3. tenant authoring/approval/source persistence — Experiences ;
4. React trace/diff/local evaluation — Experiences + Web Platform ;
5. provenance/licence/determinism qualification — Proof + Infrastructure and Release.

No Rust implementation starts while the v2 authorities remain candidates. After independent Architecture, Security and Privacy agent verdicts, Rust and UI may proceed in parallel only against accepted golden vectors.

## Release and rollback

Release requires cross-runtime golden equality, unknown/indeterminate proof, independent policy approval, source provenance/licence checks and RLS. Policy/snapshot/evaluation contracts remain readable after rollback. A faulty engine is revoked for new runs and previous engine/artifact restored; historical result hashes remain unchanged and visibly identify engine version.
