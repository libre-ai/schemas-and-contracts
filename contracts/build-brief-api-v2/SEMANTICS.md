# Specifications API v2 — candidate HTTP semantics

Candidate, unimplemented and unpublished. This source complements the exact
`contracts/openapi/specifications.v2.yaml` and
`contracts/schemas/build-brief-api.v2.schema.json` definitions; neither success
fixtures nor a schema validator grants runtime admission. The inherited
`contracts/build-brief-v2/SEMANTICS.md` supplies immutable content, strict Ed25519,
historical acceptance and plan-only handoff semantics without modification.

## Version boundary and endpoint matrix

All paths below are relative to `/v2/specifications`. Only the listed method is
supported; unsupported methods, including HEAD/OPTIONS, return 405 with exact
Allow and invoke no command. All operations require the verified session cookie
and current membership. Every POST requires canonical JSON, Idempotency-Key,
If-Match and X-CSRF-Token. All successes are `{data, meta}`; meta contains opaque
requestId and safe-integer revision. Each error is the closed content-free
`{data:null,meta:{requestId,code,message}}` schema for its exact HTTP status,
served as application/problem+json. Successes use application/json.

| Method and path | Operation / success | Required resource operation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST `/workspaces` | createSpecWorkspace / 201 workspace | independently allocated spec-workspace / author |
| GET `/workspaces/{workspaceId}` | getSpecWorkspace / 200 workspace | spec-workspace / read |
| POST `/workspaces/{workspaceId}/acceptance` | acceptSpecPackage / 201 full package | independently bound spec-package / approve on exact bodyDigest |
| GET `/workspaces/{workspaceId}/acceptance` | getAcceptanceSubject / 200 canonical signing subject | independently bound spec-package / read; no workspace-read prerequisite |
| GET `/packages/{packageId}?version=N` | getAcceptedPackage / 200 full package | spec-package / read |
| POST `/packages/{packageId}/handoffs?version=N` | createPlanningHandoff / 201 handoff | spec-package / export |
| POST `/workspaces/{workspaceId}/commands` | executeSpecCommand / 200 workspace | spec-workspace / author, except review requires review |
| GET `/workspaces/{workspaceId}/views/{view}` | getSpecView / 200 tagged page | spec-workspace / read; approvals additionally require referenced spec-package / read |
| POST `/packages/{packageId}/commands?version=N` | executePackageCommand / 200 full package | spec-package / export; command is exactly export |
| GET `/handoffs/{handoffId}` | getHandoff / 200 handoff | agent-handoff / plan |

The existing names describe retained domain purposes; the v2 route/payload is a
separate contract. No v1 OpenAPI/schema/policy changes, v1 digest reinterpretation,
automatic adapter or Missions quorum expansion are allowed. Draft authoring
fields and command variants are closed by schema; command-specific mandatory
fields cannot be supplied to unrelated commands. No generic patch/SQL endpoint.
No new key, membership, retention or signing operation is exposed. Subject
discovery is the explicit GetAcceptanceSubject query in the owning Specifications
v2 candidate protocol; it is not an implicit alias of a v1 operation.

## Current authority inputs

Consumer interfaces must provide the following named trusted ports. These are
responsibilities with exact required observations, not new wire APIs or issuers:

- `CurrentSessionAuthority`: authenticated principal, current organization and
  membership revision, cookie/CSRF validity; never roles/organization from payload.
- `BriefOwnershipAuthority`: workspace ownership, exact package id/version/body
  linkage and handoff producer/resource binding. Creation reserves one exact
  workspace identity before issuing author rights; no wildcard creation grant.
- `BriefResourceAuthorizer`: the byte-exact dedicated Build Brief policy plus
  exact current user/resource/operation/revision and, for approval, body digest
  and independently proven non-contribution. Reserved host facts cannot be issued
  by an untrusted token block. Appended blocks restrict, never invent authority.
- `HistoricalAcceptanceAuthority`: authenticated membership/role at acceptedAt,
  complete contributor provenance, historical public key validity and the exact
  acceptance record's policy. This does not replace current caller permission.
- `AcceptanceKeyAuthority`: independently approved organization/approver/key
  binding and current revocation/availability; strict key admission as well as
  each signature verification. Never trust a supplied key or cached success.
- `BriefSnapshotAuthority`: authoritative aggregate revision, exact bytes,
  idempotency outcome and reference lifecycle. It is not a permission to persist
  drafts, handoffs or full key/member history.

Unknown, ambiguous, invalid or unavailable observations fail closed. Fixture
contexts are synthetic observations only. Current membership and revocation are
rechecked for each request; historical validity alone cannot authorize export.

## Content and concurrency

Creation takes problem and actors; the trusted principal enters the contributor
set. Initial revision is 1 and If-Match is exactly `"0"`. Other writes require a
canonical quoted decimal safe integer equal to the current target revision; a
header matching the lexical pattern but exceeding MAX_SAFE_INTEGER is invalid.
No lossy number parsing. Every successful state-changing command advances its
resource revision once; exact retries return original status/body and revision.
The accepted body/receipt aggregate shares the workspace revision. Export observes
that revision without advancing it. Handoff creation checks the package revision
and returns revision 1 for the new ephemeral handoff, without modifying the package.

Workspace authoring is draft -> submitted -> accepted -> superseded. Add/record/
resolve/attach/define act only on draft. Submit requires complete body criteria and
no unresolved decision. Review requires submitted and records a decision; accepted
review is not signed package acceptance. Rejected review returns to draft.
Every actual modifying or review contributor enters independently authenticated
provenance; the payload contributor list is compared to it, never trusted alone.

Acceptance request is `{body,acceptance}`. Resolve workspace-to-package identity
independently, compare body bytes/digest to the exact submitted version, validate
the complete acceptance statement and historical/current evidence, then atomically
commit the first package and receipt. For a workspace already accepted, the same
body may receive a new valid detached acceptance under a fresh revision/key;
existing body or statement id with different bytes conflicts. Identical signed
receipt bytes are idempotent and cannot extend retention. Every response includes
all committed acceptances, each reverified; acceptance count cannot exceed 100.
No server-side signing, default approver or two-agent quorum is inferred.

Supersede is a workspace-author command, not package mutation or a new package
policy right. It requires an accepted workspace and a separately verified same-
organization successor identity/version/digest, different from the old body,
resolved through trusted ownership. It marks only the old workspace terminal;
body/receipt bytes and references remain intact. It cannot bypass the successor's
approval, grant reads, or trigger reference release by itself.

Idempotency binds current organization, principal, method, normalized path/query,
payload digest and expected revision. The same key with a different binding is
409. Authentication/authorization are rechecked even on replay; a previously
authorized result cannot leak after revocation. Concurrent identical calls commit
once. Conflicting CAS writes are 412 with no partial body/receipt/reference write.
Unknown commit outcome requires read/reconciliation against the same binding,
never a new key for a blind second effect. These are consumer tests, not provided
by the authority fixture runner.

## Frozen subject discovery before first acceptance

GET on the acceptance path returns exactly `{data:{body,bodyDigest},meta}`.
Meta carries requestId and the current workspace/acceptance revision for If-Match.
The complete body includes the independently reserved package id/version; these
are never inferred from workspace id/revision. Canonical RFC8785 body bytes and
SHA256 must agree exactly with the authoritative frozen snapshot. This response
does not require a prior acceptance and adds no signature or mutable field to the
body preimage. Its transport envelope is outside the body/statement digests.
No acceptance is required to discover the subject: it is not a spec-package
envelope and carries no acceptances collection. Reading it is not a contribution,
review, approval or workspace mutation and never changes the contributor set.

Resolve workspace ownership and the reserved package through BriefOwnershipAuthority
before data exposure, then require the existing spec-package/read operation on
that exact package. A Build Brief approver has this existing right; it need not
also have workspace/read. No package id or organization supplied by a caller may
substitute for that mapping, and no new policy role or permission is introduced.

Only submitted and accepted workspaces yield a subject. Draft, rejected-review
return-to-draft and superseded states return 409 after current authorization.
Unknown/outside-scope resource returns 404, denied current package read returns
403, and absent/ambiguous/unavailable ownership or frozen snapshot returns 503.
Incomplete/noncanonical body or mismatched computed digest is unavailable state,
not a repairable client input: return 503 without a partial subject.

Submission freezes a complete body and its reserved identity/version. A review
that changes authenticated contributor provenance must invalidate the old subject
and freeze the revised complete body under an advanced workspace revision before
it is exposed. An accepted review never leaves an obsolete contributor list in
the signing subject. Rejected review invalidates the frozen subject. Re-fetch
after any revision change; a POST based on an older discovery uses stale If-Match
and receives 412 with no receipt write. The reserved package-version policy is
explicitly supplied by ownership; advancing a workspace revision never silently
renumbers the package version.

The caller derives bodyDigest from the returned canonical body, constructs the
existing detached statement binding its exact id/version/digest and signs through
its separately qualified signing capability. POST then sends that same body and
detached record with If-Match from discovery. The server rechecks current resource
authorization, historical evidence, frozen subject and revision atomically; GET
does not reserve authority or bypass POST checks. Discovery is a projection of the
existing authoritative snapshot, not a new retained class or signing/key service.

## Reads, views, export and handoff

Package version is explicit; a route never silently chooses latest. Reads and
exports must verify canonical stored bytes, all supplied receipts and current
permission. Return full package within the inherited 2 MiB/depth-32 raw boundary;
oversized compositions are refused, not truncated or partially verified.
The wrapper's transport meta is outside every signed/digested preimage. Request
JSON is canonical RFC8785 UTF-8; schema validation never rescues duplicate keys,
BOM, invalid UTF-8, surrogate, unsafe number or noncanonical input.

Views are exactly open-decisions, validation, version-diff and approvals. Returned
data.view equals the path value. Every page is bounded to limit (default/max 100)
with meta.nextCursor mandatory: canonical opaque string or null on the final page.
Cursor binds principal, organization, workspace, view, limit, snapshot revision,
comparison version and last stable item key; authenticated tamper/cross-context,
stale snapshot and unknown cursor all return 400. No arbitrary decoded SQL offset.
Open decisions sort by id; approvals by statement id; diffs by JSON pointer;
validation returns one summary item and null cursor. A version-diff requires
compareVersion; other views refuse that parameter. Unknown/duplicate parameters,
noncanonical integers and cursor/limit disagreements are 400. Diff compares
independently owned versions; it cannot expose a foreign package or proof.

Handoff input contains the actual v2 handoff, whose id/organization/package/version
and referenced acceptanceDigest are checked against trusted context and current
package bytes. All criteria must match without duplication; times must satisfy
the inherited current interval and capabilities must be exactly [plan]. The
producer/resource binding is authenticated outside the unsigned handoff. Reading
an expired or unverifiable handoff refuses. No handoff grants execution or turns
historical acceptance into a current bearer permission.

Drafts and handoffs may be held only in bounded ephemeral memory or exported until
their storage classification is separately reviewed. An evicted/expired ephemeral
object is 404; restart may lose it. No unconditional durable idempotency guarantee
is claimed for an unqualified persistence adapter: when required authoritative
outcome cannot be reconciled, return 503 and do not re-emit an uncertain effect.
Accepted package storage must pass the previously specified joint proof/P5Y/P35D
mapping before durable admission. This API adds no retention class or interval.

## Closed HTTP refusals and evaluation order

Each code is exactly `build-brief.http_STATUS` and message exactly `Request refused`.
The public code conveys the HTTP category without leaking signature/key/member
details, input bytes, identifiers or personal facts. Internal semantic failures
remain content-free classified observations, not raw logs.

| Status | Trigger |
| --- | --- |
| 400 | invalid parameters/header grammar/canonical bytes/cursor or request shape |
| 401 | absent, invalid or expired session |
| 403 | failed CSRF/current membership/resource operation/non-contributor permission |
| 404 | unknown or outside-scope resource; do not distinguish foreign ownership |
| 405 | unsupported method, exact Allow, no handler effect |
| 409 | idempotency binding conflict, immutable identity collision or incompatible lifecycle |
| 412 | valid expected revision differs from current revision |
| 413 | bounded request or composed response exceeds byte/depth limits |
| 415 | unsupported request media type/content encoding |
| 422 | structurally valid but invalid signed package/handoff or incomplete submit/acceptance |
| 503 | unavailable/ambiguous trusted authority, missing historical proof or unresolved commit |

GET exposes only 400/401/403/404/405/503, plus 409 for subject discovery in an
ineligible workspace state: invalid or oversized stored package/handoff
is not returned and maps to 503, not a successful diagnostic. Mutations expose all listed
categories. Canonical/input schema errors map to 400; signature/semantic errors
after structural admission map to 422. Evaluate method, bounded media/transport,
session/CSRF, trusted resource scope/current permission, canonical/schema input,
idempotency/revision and semantic verification in that order. Public lookups do
not reveal existence before authorization. Transport method/size errors disclose
no resource content. Responses are no-store and must not echo user-controlled
headers/content. Consumer tests must prove status, envelope and zero mutation for
each endpoint/refusal; this contract does not implement that evaluation pipeline.

## Verification and admission

The endpoint fixture suite parses OpenAPI YAML and validates actual referenced
request/response schema definitions with strict AJV. It verifies all ten endpoint
inventories (including subject discovery), closed status sets, cookie/CSRF/revision/idempotency declarations and
per-endpoint positive/negative payloads. Inherited bytes/catalog entries are
hashed and checked independently. Ordinary contract checks retain all prior
schema, HTTP, doctrine, secret/PII and type/lint gates.

Missing consumer proof: complete actual HTTP dispatch/errors, current/historical
ports, policy attenuation matrix, cursor authentication, CAS/idempotent races,
crypto across real runtimes, API responses against schema, PostgreSQL roles/RLS,
deletion/restore, and browser author -> review -> independent approval -> export
journey with refusals. SDK generation remains upstream and byte-exact; generated
types alone are not verified inputs. Separate immutable architecture/security/
cryptography role passes and owner control precede admission or publication.
