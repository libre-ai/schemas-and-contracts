# Contract catalog — canonical lock

Machine authority: [`catalog.v1.json`](catalog.v1.json).

| Family | Count | Authority | Compatibility |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| JSON Schema 2020-12 | 75 | `contracts/schemas/` | strict payloads; additive v1 only through coordinated producer/consumer qualification; breaking changes use a new major |
| Retention policy | 2 | `contracts/data/` | exact lifecycle projections; v2 preserves v1 and adds two bounded execution classes |
| OpenAPI 3.1 | 11 | `contracts/openapi/` | routes and payload majors remain aligned |
| WIT worlds | 9 | `contracts/wit/` | exact major-versioned component boundary + cataloged profile |
| Biscuit authority/policies | 6 | `contracts/authz/` | minimal authorities plus deny-by-default authorizers |

The catalog records one ID, path, owner set, consumer set, classification, compatibility mode and
status for every contract. Of 103 current entries, 99 are `locked` and 4 are `candidate`. A
`pending-independent-agent-review` candidate does not authorize implementation or release and
requires dedicated review-only verdicts under
Governance [`AGENT-REVIEW-PROTOCOL.md`](https://github.com/libre-ai/governance/blob/main/docs/reviews/AGENT-REVIEW-PROTOCOL.md).

Some locked engine profiles and vector payloads retain candidate-era status strings because their exact
bytes are hash-bound review evidence. Those embedded strings are historical metadata, not live catalog
state. They must not be edited merely to reconcile wording: any byte change follows compatibility and
re-review rules. `catalog.v1.json` is the sole live status authority.

Uncataloged files and missing authorities fail `bun run check:contracts`.

## Shared contracts

- `work-package-plan.v1`: exclusive agent paths, dependencies and human gates ;
- `browser-session.v1`: opaque server-side browser session record ;
- `retention-policy.v1` and `deletion-receipt.v1`: executable lifecycle and deletion evidence ;
- `problem-details.v1`: stable HTTP refusal envelope ;
- `evidence-report.v1`: attributable gate results ;
- `artifact-manifest.v1`: content-addressed release/export/evidence files ;
- `agent-handoff.v1`: planning-only Specifications → Missions boundary ;
- `common.v1`: identifiers, tenant IDs, digests, source, artifact and approval references ;
- `engine-golden-vectors.v1`: locked bounded public-vector envelope; engine WIT/semantics and dedicated
  checkers remain authoritative, with no product/runtime authorization.

## Application contracts

- Website: public projection and correction record ;
- Practices: activity definition/outcome and local progress export ;
- Radar: locked v2 source-scoped parsing/rules with exact normalized feed/item and bounded output ;
- Notebook: locked context v2 plus authenticated Argon2id/AES-GCM backup envelope; runtime use remains gated ;
- Sessions: event and audience-safe export ;
- Model Policy: locked v1 and v2 policy/need/snapshot/evaluation boundaries with human approval separation ;
- Boussole: locked v1 and v2 reviewed dataset/method/responses/comparison boundaries, with public scoring disabled ;
- Specifications: immutable SpecPackage and planning handoff ;
- Missions: locked v1 human-verdict baseline plus locked, unimplemented v2 two-agent plan/result quorums ;
- Agent Orchestrator/Harness: locked immutable plan, separate authorization, causal events, monotone budgets and signed fail-closed isolation profile/attestation; only the simulation control core is implemented, never a harness or worker runtime.

## Authorized execution Specification Lock

Eleven coordinated entries are locked under Governance ADR-0036/D42: `execution-graph-v1`,
`execution-plan-body-v2`, `execution-transfer-v1`, `execution-authorization-v2`,
`human-decision-request-v1`, `human-decision-response-v1`, `step-invocation-v1`,
`effect-attestation-v1`, `orchestrator-event-v3`, `retention-policy-schema-v2` and
`retention-policy-v2`. Their shared dossier records architecture, security and privacy verdicts
against an immutable authoring commit plus the separate promotion review. SDK projections may be
generated only from the pinned lock authority. The lock stabilizes contract meaning; runtime
adoption, real missions, effects, services and deployments remain separate gates.
