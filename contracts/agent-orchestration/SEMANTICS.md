# Agent orchestration semantics v1

- **Status:** normative for the cataloged locked contracts; no implementation or real mission is
  authorized.
- **RFC:** `docs/rfcs/0001-agent-orchestration-option-b.md`
- **Normative JSON:** the cataloged schemas under `contracts/schemas/`.

## Canonical JSON and digests

Every digest preimage uses RFC 8785 JSON Canonicalization Scheme (JCS), encoded as UTF-8 without BOM or trailing newline. SHA-256 output is 32 bytes rendered as 64 lowercase hexadecimal characters.

The following digest fields are excluded from their own preimage and every signature field is also excluded:

| Contract | Digest field | Excluded fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ExecutionPlanBody v1` | `bodyDigest` | `bodyDigest` |
| `AgentContributorLineage v1` | `lineageDigest` | `lineageDigest`, `signature` |
| `AgentReview v1` | `preimageDigest` | `preimageDigest`, `signature` |
| `AgentReviewSessionAttestation v1` | `attestationDigest` | `attestationDigest`, `signature` |
| `AgentReviewQuorum v1` | `quorumDigest` | `quorumDigest` |
| `ExecutionAuthorization v1` | `authorizationDigest` | `authorizationDigest` |
| `OrchestratorEvent v2` | `eventDigest` | `eventDigest` |
| `HarnessProfile v1` | `profileDigest` | `profileDigest` |
| `HarnessAttestation v1` | `attestationDigest` | `attestationDigest`, `signature` |

An implementation must reject non-canonical input before computing a digest. It must not parse and silently reserialize a non-canonical payload into an accepted object.

## Signatures

Lineage, review-session, review and harness-attestation signatures use Ed25519. `signature` is the canonical Base64url encoding without padding of exactly 64 bytes, hence 86 characters.

The signed message is:

```text
UTF8(schemaVersion) || 0x00 || raw_32_bytes(digest)
```

`signingKeyId` selects a key from an approved harness key registry. Unknown, expired or revoked keys fail closed. Key-registry outage fails closed. Signature verification happens before quorum evaluation and emits no rejected value or signature bytes in logs.

## Contributor lineage

The harness constructs lineage only from its own signed observations of writes, hunks and corrections. A worker-provided contributor list has no authority.

For a result, every agent that authored, executed, fixed or edited any byte contributing to `subjectDigest` appears exactly once in `contributors`. The lineage `subjectDigest` must equal the reviewed subject digest. `contributorAgentIds` in each review is the sorted list of those `agentId` values and its `contributorLineage.digest` equals `lineageDigest`; any omission or divergence fails closed.

An empty contributor list is permitted only for a deterministically compiled execution plan whose input authorities and compiler manifest are present in `observations`. Missing or divergent observations fail closed.

## Review eligibility and blind review

A review is eligible only when all conditions hold:

1. tenant, mission, subject type and subject digest match the review request;
2. the reviewer identity and run are issued by the harness roster, not by the worker;
3. the contributor-lineage signature and completeness checks succeed against harness observations;
4. the signed review-session attestation proves trusted roster identity, read-only isolation, no shared mutable state and non-disclosure; every duplicated reviewer/pool/runtime/model/provider/profile field in the review is byte-identical to that attestation;
5. `reviewerAgentId` is absent from the contributor lineage;
6. the two quorum reviews have distinct reviewer agent IDs, distinct reviewer run IDs, distinct nonces and distinct signatures;
7. both reviews reference the same lineage digest and exact set of evidence digests;
8. `issuedAt <= evaluation time < expiresAt` and `issuedAt < expiresAt`;
9. nonce claim succeeds exactly once in the replay store and leaves a durable claim receipt; outage fails closed;
10. `blindReview` is `true` and the signed harness disclosure record proves that no sibling verdict or findings were available before irreversible submission;
11. signing key, signature and preimage digest verify;
12. verdict is `approve` and summary contains no `blocking` or `major` finding.

Any `reject`, invalid review or changed subject/evidence/lineage digest prevents quorum for that digest. A `plan-rejected` or result `rejected` projection carries the exact eligible signed rejection-review reference; rejection is never inferred from an empty review set. Remediation creates a new digest and requires two new reviews. A reviewer that modifies the subject becomes a contributor and is ineligible to review the new digest.

The threshold is two favorable reviews. High-risk policy may additionally require `reviewer-pool`, `runtime-family`, `model-family` or `provider` diversity. `diversityRequirements` must exactly match the requirements resolved by `policyDigest`, and both reviews must differ on every named dimension. The policy cannot reduce the threshold or permit self-review.

## Quorum state

`AgentReviewQuorum v1` contains exactly two full reviews. All duplicated tenant, mission, subject and lineage fields must be byte-identical across the quorum and both reviews. `reachedAt` is not earlier than either `issuedAt` and remains before both `expiresAt` values.

Missions computes `quorumDigest` only after all semantic checks pass. `ExecutionAuthorization` is a server-owned consequence of the accepted plan quorum, never a reviewer-callable API command. A JSON-Schema-valid document that fails any semantic check is refused with a closed reason code and cannot transition a mission.

## Mission transitions

The v2 transition relation is closed:

| From | Allowed next states |
| --- | --- |
| `proposed` | `assessed`, `abandoned` |
| `assessed` | `plan-review`, `abandoned` |
| `plan-review` | `plan-rejected`, `authorized`, `abandoned` |
| `plan-rejected` | `plan-review` on a new digest, `abandoned` |
| `authorized` | `running`, `cancelled`, `abandoned` |
| `running` | `blocked`, `paused`, `cancelled`, `failed`, `result-submitted` |
| `blocked` | `running`, `paused`, `cancelled`, `failed` |
| `paused` | `running`, `cancelled`, `failed` |
| `result-submitted` | `result-review` |
| `result-review` | `rejected`, `validated` |
| `rejected` | `result-submitted` on a new result/evidence/lineage digest, `abandoned` |
| `cancelled`, `validated`, `failed`, `abandoned` | none |

Every unlisted transition is refused. `plan-review → authorized` requires a valid plan quorum and `ExecutionAuthorization`. Transition to `running` additionally requires a signed `HarnessAttestation v1` whose requested profile and effective controls satisfy the plan; a missing capability or attestation refuses startup. `result-review → validated` requires a valid result quorum over artifact, evidence and contributor-lineage digests. `validated` is technical validation by two other agents, not an individual agent verdict.

A protected human gate remains an additional prerequisite for canonical contracts, authorization, migrations, releases and deployments. It never substitutes for either agent review.

## Control and causal events

Control commands are idempotent by `(tenantId, missionId, idempotencyKey)`; non-start controls additionally bind the exact `runId`. A `start` control never preselects a run ID: the orchestrator creates it only after plan, authorization, token, quorum and harness preflight verification. `start`, `pause` and `resume` reject stale revisions. An authorized `cancel` targeting the exact run, plan and authorization remains monotone even when `expectedRevision` is stale; it cannot target another run.

For event sequence 1, `previousEventDigest` is null. For every later event it equals the accepted prior event digest. Duplicate event ID or sequence is idempotent only when the previously verified canonical digest matches; any divergence quarantines the event and cannot project success. Tenant, mission, run, orchestrator, plan and authorization identities remain byte-identical across the chain. Sequence increments by exactly one and the predecessor digest equals the accepted prior event; causal-store outage fails closed.

Before projection, the TypeScript/Rust event-chain validator checks these identities and component-wise budget arithmetic against accepted state. Every budget total is component-wise greater than or equal to the prior accepted total. Delta plus prior total equals current total. Retry, pause, resume and worker replacement never decrement totals.

## Privacy and evidence

Review summaries contain only closed codes, severity and counts. Detailed findings are tenant-private evidence artifacts with approved retention. Agent/reviewer IDs, review references, subject digests and findings never enter operational logs or OTEL attributes.

Views and exports disclose reviewer and contributor identities only to authorized roles with a need to know. Deletion, anonymization and restore replay follow `docs/specifications/DATA-LIFECYCLE.md`; accepted deletion cannot be resurrected.

## Authorized execution locked family (D40/D42)

The following contracts are a coordinated **locked** family: `ExecutionGraph v1`,
`ExecutionPlanBody v2`, `ExecutionTransfer v1`, `ExecutionAuthorization v2`,
`HumanDecisionRequest v1`, `HumanDecisionResponse v1`, `StepInvocation v1`,
`EffectAttestation v1`, `OrchestratorEvent v3`, `RetentionPolicy v2` and its schema. They
authorize neither a runtime implementation nor a real mission. Governance ADR-0036/D42 records
the separate owner Specification Lock after the required architecture, security and privacy
reviews; any breaking semantic change requires a new major and a new lock cycle.

### Closed graph and authority binding

An execution graph is a finite, sequential and acyclic authority: 1–256 steps, 0–512 edges,
exactly one entry, total routing for every declared non-terminal outcome and no outgoing route
from a terminal. Every reachable step must be able to reach a terminal. Declaration order does
not resolve ambiguity. Duplicate identities, dangling edges, missing or multiple routes,
unreachable steps and cycles fail with the closed outcomes in
`fixtures/authorized-execution-v1/semantic-vectors.v1.json`.

Plan v2 retains every v1 capability, filesystem, network, model-egress, harness and budget bound.
It additionally binds the graph, decision schemas, executor profiles and organization. Initial
plans require generation 1 and no predecessor. Successor plans require generation > 1 and the
complete predecessor run, plan, sealed revision, terminal-effect inventory and transfer binding.
No graph engine or SDK may infer or expand any of these authorities.

### One-shot lineage, decisions and effects

Transfers consume one predecessor generation exactly once. A byte-identical replay is
idempotent; reuse of an ID or sequence with a different canonical digest quarantines. Event
sequence increments by one, preserves the full authority identity tuple and satisfies
component-wise checked budget arithmetic. A successor is forbidden while any predecessor effect
is `reserved`, `started` or `state-unknown`.

Human decisions bind one organization, run, step, attempt, request digest, revision and closed
choice set. Requests expire and are consumed once. Responses carry an opaque actor reference and
an optional classified artifact reference, never a free-text comment. An `other` choice must have
been preauthorized and can only select `replan-required`.

Each external-effect attempt owns at most one emission ID. Effect attestations bind the active
generation, executor profile and exactly one deduplication proof: fencing or executor-idempotency
evidence. Only `committed`, `rejected-final` and `not-committed-final` close the effect inventory;
`state-unknown` creates a continuity barrier. Attestations are Ed25519-signed over the declared
preimage digest using the signature framing already defined above.

### Content-free events and retention

Event v3 payloads contain closed codes and content-addressed lifecycle references. Prompts, tool
arguments, decision comments, effect destinations, raw observations, paths and raw errors are not
event or diagnostic fields. Operational errors expose only closed outcomes and aggregate
counters, never identifiers or digests.

Retention v2 preserves every v1 rule byte-for-byte. It adds only a content-free orchestrator
execution record (`P1Y`, configurable to `P6Y`, equal to the owning mission retention) and a
content-free deletion tombstone (`P35D`, the backup ceiling). Restore applies tombstones before
execution records. After tombstone expiry, no backup capable of resurrecting the deleted lineage
remains.

### Canonical vectors

`fixtures/authorized-execution-v1/digest-vectors.v1.json` contains the nine explicit RFC 8785
unsigned preimages. Array order is authoritative; object-key order is not. The effect-attestation
preimage excludes both `preimageDigest` and `signature`; every other preimage excludes its own
digest field. `check:contracts` reproduces each SHA-256, checks fixture equality and rejects an
excluded field inside an unsigned payload.

The semantic vector file covers every closed graph, causal, decision and effect outcome. It is a
portable conformance oracle for SDKs and future runtimes, not a runtime state machine. LangGraph
may generate additional questions and failure scenarios, but it is neither a dependency nor a
source of authority.
