# Canonical contracts

JSON Schema, OpenAPI, WIT and Biscuit policies are the only cross-module protocol authority. Generated Rust/TypeScript types are disposable projections and cannot override these files.

## Layout

- `catalog.v1.json` — machine-readable ownership and compatibility registry ;
- `schemas/` — strict JSON Schema 2020-12 payloads ;
- `data/` — approved executable retention policy ;
- `openapi/` — OpenAPI 3.1 HTTP surfaces and complete domain command/query inventory ;
- `wit/` — capability-free Rust/WASM component worlds and their cataloged normative profiles ;
- `authz/` — deny-by-default Biscuit authorizer policies ;
- `fixtures/` — portable positive and explicit negative schema vectors.

OpenAPI `x-libre-ai-domain` lists the complete protocol from each application specification. Only commands/queries crossing HTTP appear under `paths`; local and offline commands remain visible without becoming endpoints.

A `candidate` catalog entry is machine-checkable but not approved: it carries a dossier listing at least role-separated architecture and security review, plus cryptography, methodology or privacy where required. In solo work, the same agent/session may perform serial authoring and dedicated review-only passes under Governance [`AGENT-REVIEW-PROTOCOL.md`](https://github.com/libre-ai/governance/blob/main/docs/reviews/AGENT-REVIEW-PROTOCOL.md). Promotion requires every attributable role verdict, a separate promotion pass and the human control milestone. Cataloged WIT `profiles` and `vectors` are normative adjuncts to that world.

The coordinated authorized-execution family is currently candidate-only: graph v1, plan v2,
transfer v1, authorization v2, human decision request/response v1, step invocation v1, effect
attestation v1, orchestrator event v3 and retention policy/schema v2. Its shared review dossier is
`docs/reviews/authorized-execution-contracts-review.md`. These contracts do not authorize runtime
adoption, and no LangGraph library or behavior is normative.

## Verification

`bun run check:contracts` fails on:

- uncataloged/missing/duplicate authority ;
- non-strict or invalid JSON Schema and unresolved references ;
- rejected positive fixture or accepted negative/unknown-field fixture ;
- divergence between application protocols and OpenAPI inventory ;
- unversioned routes, missing idempotency/revision/CSRF or refusal responses ;
- WIT host imports and malformed package/world conventions ;
- retention rules diverging from their schema or backup ceiling ;
- authorized-execution semantic vectors with incomplete closed outcomes, unsafe content or a
  non-reproducible result ;
- RFC 8785 preimages containing their own digest/signature, diverging from positive fixtures or
  producing a different SHA-256 ;
- Biscuit authority expansion, token-supplied revocation IDs, allow rules without user/role/matching tenant, or missing final deny.

Cargo tests parse/resolve all WIT worlds with `wit-parser` and parse the Biscuit authority plus policy sources with `biscuit-parser`. Security behavior remains subject to end-to-end authorizer vectors when the G2 authz capability is implemented.
