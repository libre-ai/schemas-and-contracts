# policy-core-v2 — normative semantics

Status: **cataloged candidate**. It defines conformance but authorizes no implementation until independent architecture, security and privacy approval.

This document is normative for `libre-ai:policy-core@2.0.0`. The JSON Schemas and
`world.wit` define the accepted bytes and boundary; this document defines the only
valid evaluation, ordering and hashing behavior. The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**,
**SHOULD** and **MAY** have the meaning defined by RFC 2119.

## 1. Scope and safety boundary

`PolicyEvaluation` is an advisory eligibility statement for one approved policy,
one sourced model snapshot, one declared need and one explicit instant. `eligible`
means only “all rules are satisfied for these exact inputs”. It is not a ranking,
purchase recommendation, authorization, approval or instruction to transact.
The evaluator MUST NOT buy, select, deploy or approve anything and MUST NOT create
or mutate a policy approval. It verifies approval separation and subject binding,
but the authorized caller MUST establish the authenticity and current validity of
`approval.reference` before invocation.

The world is pure. It receives no clock, network, storage, identity, authorization
or randomness capability. The caller authorizes access before invoking it. The
resolved WIT world exports one `api` interface and MUST have zero imports.

`engineVersion` MUST be an immutable SemVer constant embedded in the qualified
component. It MUST NOT be accepted from the caller or derived from any input. The
reference vectors use `2.0.0`; changing the embedded version changes the evaluation
content, ID and digest even when all policy inputs are unchanged.

## 2. Accepted values and validation order

Inputs are UTF-8 JSON objects conforming respectively to:

1. `policy-definition.v2.schema.json` (maximum 8 MiB);
2. `model-snapshot.v2.schema.json` (maximum 8 MiB);
3. `policy-need.v2.schema.json` (maximum 8 MiB).

`evaluated-at` is exactly 20 UTF-8 bytes when valid and the successful JCS output is at most 2 MiB. A larger input or output returns `policy.input_invalid` without partial output.

Before any decode, the evaluator MUST check the byte lengths of all three JSON
inputs and `evaluated-at`; a value above its ceiling returns `policy.input_invalid`.
After producing successful JCS bytes, the evaluator MUST apply the output ceiling
before returning them, with the same refusal. Exact-ceiling values pass preflight.

Before implementation, `contracts/fixtures/policy-core-v2/resource-budgets.v1.json`
fixes the qualification ceilings and exact/+1 boundary cases derived from these schemas. At most 1,000 rules
and 1,000 facts in either namespace can produce 1,000,000 matched rule/occurrence
evaluations. A policy set has at most 100 members; set lookup MUST use sorted binary
search or an equivalent lookup with at most 7 scalar comparisons, never a linear
100-member scan for every occurrence. Duplicate detection MUST use canonical hashes
or ordered indexes, not pairwise deep comparison. Peak component linear memory,
including WIT input/output copies, decoded values, indexes, canonicalization/hashing scratch and
the result, MUST NOT exceed 256 MiB. Caller-owned buffers outside component linear
memory are excluded. A schema-valid input within all byte/cardinality ceilings MUST
NOT be refused merely because an implementation chose a less efficient algorithm;
such a component fails qualification. Wall-clock and WASM fuel thresholds are set
only in implementation Gate B against the exact component, runtime and documented
reference hardware; they cannot alter these deterministic work ceilings.

The decoder MUST reject a BOM, invalid UTF-8, duplicate JSON object member names,
unpaired Unicode surrogates, nesting deeper than 64 values and non-JSON numbers. Every JSON number is interpreted
as an IEEE-754 binary64 value and is schema-bounded to the inclusive safe-integer
range `[-9007199254740991, 9007199254740991]`; fractional values in that range are
allowed. `-0` and `0` are equal. Strings are never case-folded, trimmed or Unicode-
normalized.

Every policy and fact source URI MUST be a sanitized public HTTPS citation with
a DNS-shaped host containing a public-style alphabetic top-level label, no IP
literal, `localhost`, userinfo, query, fragment or percent encoding, and at most
2,048 characters. It MUST NOT contain
credentials, tokens, email addresses or other personal data. `proposedBy` is an
opaque `usr_*` or `svc_*` principal ID; `approval.approverId` is an opaque `usr_*`
ID and never a name, email or external account identifier. `modelId` is an opaque
`mdl_*` identifier. String facts are bounded machine tokens without whitespace or
`@`; fact names/values and need facts MUST describe models and organizational
requirements only. They MUST NOT contain natural-person identifiers, free-form
personal content, credentials or secrets. The authorized caller owns identity mapping, data
minimization and source sanitization before invocation.

`evaluated-at`, every snapshot `source.retrievedAt` and every emitted `evaluatedAt`
MUST be a real Gregorian instant in the exact UTC-seconds form
`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`. Leap seconds and fractional seconds are rejected.

Validation occurs before rule evaluation, in this order:

1. apply input byte preflight, otherwise `policy.input_invalid`;
2. decode with depth at most 64 and validate all three schemas, otherwise `policy.input_invalid`;
3. validate `evaluated-at`, otherwise `policy.evaluated_at_invalid`;
4. reject repeated rule IDs, otherwise `policy.rule_id_duplicate`;
5. require `approval.actorKind = human` and `approval.approverId != proposedBy`, otherwise
   `policy.approval_invalid`;
6. verify the three input digests and `approval.subjectDigest`, otherwise
   `policy.digest_mismatch`;
7. require exact equality of policy, snapshot and need `tenantId`, otherwise
   `policy.tenant_mismatch`.

A failure returns only the closed WIT `error-code`, never a `PolicyEvaluation` or
free-form string. The host maps variants to the public code and optional static
label below; no input value, parser diagnostic, tenant, fact, reviewer identity or
library error crosses the component boundary.

| WIT variant | Public code | Optional host label |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `input-invalid` | `policy.input_invalid` | `input does not conform to policy-core-v2` |
| `evaluated-at-invalid` | `policy.evaluated_at_invalid` | `evaluated-at is not canonical UTC seconds` |
| `rule-id-duplicate` | `policy.rule_id_duplicate` | `policy contains duplicate rule ids` |
| `approval-invalid` | `policy.approval_invalid` | `policy approval separation is invalid` |
| `digest-mismatch` | `policy.digest_mismatch` | `input digest does not match canonical content` |
| `tenant-mismatch` | `policy.tenant_mismatch` | `policy, snapshot and need tenants differ` |

The v2 HTTP boundary exposes only a stable `error.code` and opaque `requestId`.
It MUST NOT serialize the optional host label or any free-form message. A UI MAY
map the code to a local static translation after receiving the refusal.

## 3. Fact namespaces, cardinality and duplicates

A rule resolves its `fact` by exact name only:

- `need.*` names are looked up only in `PolicyNeed.facts`;
- `model.*` names are looked up only in `ModelSnapshot.facts`.

There is no fallback, alias, path traversal, case folding or derived fact. A name
may occur zero, one or several times. Exact duplicate fact objects are rejected by
the schemas (`uniqueItems: true`). Equal name/value pairs with distinct snapshot
sources are not exact duplicates and remain distinct occurrences.

- zero occurrences produce `unknown / policy.fact_absent`;
- one occurrence is evaluated directly;
- several occurrences are all evaluated (universal, not existential semantics),
  then reduced with `failed > unknown > satisfied`.

Thus no implementation may cherry-pick a satisfying occurrence. Input array order
never affects a rule status.

## 4. Operator and type matrix

A fact occurrence is always one scalar. Arrays are policy sets and are legal only
as the right-hand value of `in` and `not-in`.

| operator | rule `value` | occurrence | predicate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `equals` | string, number or boolean | same scalar type | `occurrence = value` |
| `not-equals` | string, number or boolean | same scalar type | `occurrence ≠ value` |
| `in` | non-empty homogeneous set of strings, numbers or booleans | same type as set items | some set item equals occurrence |
| `not-in` | non-empty homogeneous set of strings, numbers or booleans | same type as set items | no set item equals occurrence |
| `at-least` | number | number | `occurrence ≥ value` |
| `at-most` | number | number | `occurrence ≤ value` |

String equality is exact Unicode scalar-sequence equality. Boolean equality is
exact. Number equality and ordering use IEEE-754 binary64 comparisons; schemas
exclude NaN and infinities. Set order has no meaning. No coercion is permitted:
`"1"`, `1` and `true` are three different types. An occurrence with a disallowed
type is `unknown / policy.fact_type_mismatch`; negated operators MUST NOT turn a
type mismatch into satisfaction. A rule with a disallowed operator/value
combination is schema-invalid and returns `policy.input_invalid`.

## 5. Freshness

`maxSourceAgeDays` is legal only for a `model.*` rule. For each matched model fact,
let:

```text
ageSeconds = instant(evaluated-at) - instant(fact.source.retrievedAt)
maximumAgeSeconds = maxSourceAgeDays × 86400
```

The multiplication is exact integer arithmetic. The occurrence is fresh iff
`0 ≤ ageSeconds ≤ maximumAgeSeconds`; the upper boundary is inclusive.

- `ageSeconds < 0` gives `unknown / policy.source_from_future`, whether or not a
  maximum age is configured;
- if a maximum is configured and `ageSeconds > maximumAgeSeconds`, the occurrence
  gives `unknown / policy.snapshot_stale`;
- without a maximum, any non-future source age is accepted.

Freshness is checked before type and operator evaluation. Need facts have no source
age. The policy rule's own source date and snapshot `capturedAt` are not substituted
for the matched fact's `retrievedAt`.

## 6. Occurrence and rule evaluation

For each occurrence, in order:

1. apply the freshness rules when it is a model fact;
2. require the operator's occurrence type;
3. evaluate the predicate in section 4;
4. emit `satisfied / policy.rule_satisfied` when true, otherwise
   `failed / policy.rule_failed`.

A rule reduces its occurrence outcomes by status priority:

1. any `failed` → `failed / policy.rule_failed`;
2. otherwise any `unknown` → `unknown`, choosing the first present reason in this
   fixed order: `policy.source_from_future`, `policy.snapshot_stale`,
   `policy.fact_type_mismatch`, `policy.fact_absent`;
3. otherwise → `satisfied / policy.rule_satisfied`.

Exactly one `ruleResult` is emitted per policy rule. `ruleResults` MUST be sorted by
ascending raw ASCII `rule.id`; IDs are unique and schema-limited to ASCII. Policy
rule order, fact order and set-item order MUST NOT affect this output order.

## 7. Verdict

After every rule has a result:

1. if any result is `failed`, verdict is `ineligible`;
2. otherwise, if any result is `unknown` and at least one corresponding rule has
   `unknown: ineligible`, verdict is `ineligible`;
3. otherwise, if any result is `unknown`, verdict is `indeterminate`;
4. otherwise every result is `satisfied` and verdict is `eligible`.

The result status remains `unknown` when its rule maps unknown to `ineligible`; the
verdict records the disposition without falsifying the evidence state. Therefore:

- `eligible` has only satisfied results;
- `indeterminate` has at least one unknown result and no failed result;
- `ineligible` has at least one failed result, or at least one unknown result whose
  policy disposition is `ineligible`.

A failed rule has priority over all unknown rules. Unknown can never yield
`eligible`, and no UI or caller may override it to `eligible`.

## 8. Origin is not jurisdiction

The evaluator MUST NOT derive, copy or approximate a jurisdiction from model,
provider or company origin; hosting country; headquarters; source URI; model ID;
or any other fact. In particular, `model.provider.origin` does not satisfy a rule
on `model.hosting.jurisdiction`. If the exact jurisdiction fact is absent, the rule
is unknown. If origin and jurisdiction are both present and differ, each remains
an independent fact and only the exact rule name is read.

A source adapter that labels origin-derived data as jurisdiction violates this
contract and MUST be refused upstream as `policy.origin_jurisdiction_conflated`.
The pure evaluator itself performs no inference and cannot repair provenance.

## 9. Canonicalization and digests

`JCS(x)` is RFC 8785 JSON Canonicalization Scheme over the validated IEEE-754 value.
`H(label, x)` is lowercase hexadecimal SHA-256 over these exact bytes:

```text
UTF8(label) || 0x00 || JCS(normalize(x))
```

Normalization changes only arrays declared unordered by this section:

- policy `rules`: sort by ascending rule `id`;
- `in`/`not-in` rule sets: sort by ascending JCS scalar bytes;
- need facts: sort by `(name, type-rank, JCS(value))`;
- snapshot facts: sort by `(name, type-rank, JCS(value), JCS(source))`;
- evaluation `ruleResults`: already sorted by rule ID.

The type rank is `boolean = 0`, `number = 1`, `string = 2`. All comparisons above
are bytewise unsigned lexicographic comparisons. No other array is reordered.

Input digests are:

- policy: `H("libre-ai.policy-definition.v2", {schemaVersion, id, tenantId,
  version, status, proposedBy, rules})`; both `policy.digest` and
  `policy.approval.subjectDigest` MUST equal it;
- snapshot: `H("libre-ai.model-snapshot.v2", snapshot without digest)`;
- need: `H("libre-ai.policy-need.v2", need without digest)`.

After verdict and sorted rule results are known, construct the unsigned evaluation
with these fields and no others, in any object-member order:

```text
schemaVersion, tenantId, policyId, policyDigest, snapshotId, snapshotDigest,
needDigest, engineVersion, verdict, ruleResults, evaluatedAt
```

Then:

```text
evaluationDigest = H("libre-ai.policy-evaluation.v2", unsignedEvaluation)
id = "urn:libre-ai:evaluation:" || evaluationDigest
digest = evaluationDigest
```

The final object is the unsigned evaluation plus `id` and `digest`. The digest does
not include either field, avoiding recursion; the ID is content-addressed by the
same digest. Given the same semantic inputs, engine version and evaluated instant,
TypeScript and Rust MUST emit byte-identical JCS output, ID, digest, verdict and
ordered trace.

## 10. Conformance vectors

- `contracts/fixtures/policy-core-v2/operators.json` is the atomic operator/type
  corpus;
- `contracts/fixtures/policy-core-v2/golden.json` contains complete cross-runtime
  evaluations and closed WIT `error-code` vectors;
- `contracts/fixtures/policy-core-v2/resource-budgets.v1.json` fixes byte,
  cardinality, semantic-work and peak-memory qualification ceilings.

An implementation conforms only if every vector and budget matches exactly.
Implementations MUST NOT rewrite expected vectors from their own output.
